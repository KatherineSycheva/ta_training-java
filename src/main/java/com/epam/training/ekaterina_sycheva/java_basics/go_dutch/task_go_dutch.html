	<h3 id="description">Description</h3>
	<p>Consider a company of friends visiting a restaurant.
	They decided to equally split the bill.</p>
	<p>Friends decided to add 10 percent of the bill total amount as tips.

		<li>Bill total amount cannot be negative. If input value is negative, the program stops, printing: <code>Bill total amount cannot be negative</code></li>
		<li>Number of friends cannot be negative or zero. If input value is, then the program stops, printing: <code>Number of friends cannot be negative or zero</code></li>
		<li>Bill total amount, number of friends and part to pay are integers</li>
