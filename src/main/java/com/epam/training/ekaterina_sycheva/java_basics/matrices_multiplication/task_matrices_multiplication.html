	<p>The purpose of this exercise is to train you to work with arrays.</p>
	<p>Estimated workload of this exercise is <em>60 min</em>.</p>
	<h3 id="description">Description</h3>
	<p>Please, proceed to <code>MultiplyMatrix</code>
	  class and implement its <code>multiply</code> method.</p>
	<p>It takes two rectangular integer arrays (matrices) and returns the result of their multiplication.</p>
	<p>Consider two integer matrices represented as <strong>rectangular arrays</strong>. The task is to <strong>multiply</strong> given matrices. The
	  definition of <strong>matrix multiplication</strong> indicates a row-by-column multiplication,
	  where the entries in the <strong>i-th</strong> row of <em>A</em>
	  are multiplied by the corresponding entries in the <strong>j-th</strong> column of <em>B</em>
	  and then the <strong>ij-th</strong> element of the resulting matrix is the sum of that multiplication results.</p>
	<p>Note that it is guaranteed that
	  the number of columns in the first matrix
	  is equal to the number of rows in the second matrix.</p>
	<h3 id="example">Example</h3>
	<p>Input:</p>
	<pre><code>    {{1, 2, 3},
		{4, 5, 6}},

		{{7 , 8 },
		{9 , 10},
		{11, 12}}
	</code></pre>
	<p>Output:</p>
	<pre><code>    {{58 , 64 },
		{139, 154}}
	</code></pre>
