	<p>The purpose of this exercise is to train you to use extend classes with <code>extends</code> keyword.</p>
	<p>Estimated workload of this exercise is <em>30 min</em>.</p>
	<p>Note, that if you have not done the &quot;Decrementing Carousel&quot; exercise,
	you have to implement <code>DecrementingCarousel</code> and <code>CarouselRun</code> classes.
	Details are specified in <a href="../decrementing_carousel/task_decrementing_carousel.html">DC</a>.</p>
	<h3 id="description">Description</h3>
	<p>In this exercise you need to extend <code>DecrementingCarousel</code>.
	You need to implement <code>DecrementingCarouselWithLimitedRun</code>.
	This subclass must decrement elements as a usual DecrementingCarousel.
	The difference is that this implementation must produce a carousel run,
	which limits number of calls to the <code>next</code> method.
	When the limit of calls reached carousel run must consider itself finished.</p>
