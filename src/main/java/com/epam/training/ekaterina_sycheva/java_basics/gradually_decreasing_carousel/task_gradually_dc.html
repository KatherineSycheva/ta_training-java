	<p>The purpose of this exercise is to train you to use extend classes with <code>extends</code> keyword.</p>
	<p>Estimated workload of this exercise is <em>30 min</em>.</p>
	<p>Note, that if you have not done the &quot;Decrementing Carousel&quot; exercise,
	you have to implement <code>DecrementingCarousel</code> and <code>CarouselRun</code> classes.
	Details are specified in <a href="../decrementing_carousel/task_decrementing_carousel.html">DC</a>.</p>
	<h3 id="description">Description</h3>
	<p>In this exercise you need to extend <code>DecrementingCarousel</code>.
	You need to implement <code>GraduallyDecreasingCarousel</code>.
	This subclass must decrement elements by gradually increasing decrement.
	When you need to decrement an element for the first time, decrease it by <code>1</code>.
	Next time you need to decrement the same element, decrease it by <code>2</code>.
	Next time decrease by <code>3</code>, then by <code>4</code> and so on. 
	Remember that you must not make process non-positive elements.</p>
